g,okay right come eh vertically down to just below the word banana tree,instruct,10,q4ec2
f,okay,acknowledge,10,q4ec2
g,now ehm since this obstacle is missing eh we can either go down and follow the exact same path as they've gone or we can go across to the rope bridge and down there ehm,instruct,10,q4ec2
g,just wondering i suppose i ought to keep it the same as what they've got,explain,10,q4ec2
g,so ehm come down 'til you're just below the level of the word rope bridge eh just a vertical line straight down just draw it straight down,instruct,10,q4ec2
