g,i-- is there is there a picket fence underneath it,check,8,q1nc1
f,mmhmm,reply_y,8,q1nc1
g,well,ready,8,q1nc1
g,could you make a line go round it and then c--,instruct,8,q1nc1
g,is it bet-- is it like down and then the old mill's above from it,query_yn,8,q1nc1
f,yeah,reply_y,8,q1nc1
f,the the old mill's like northeast of it,explain,8,q1nc1
g,so can you not go round the picket fence and round the old mill do you not have to go round the picket fence no,check,8,q1nc1
f,i don't think so,reply_n,8,q1nc1
f,that that's what we did first of all th-- the the the first line,explain,8,q1nc1
g,uh-huh,acknowledge,8,q1nc1
g,uh-huh,acknowledge,8,q1nc1
f,when i was asking you whether i could you know i had to eh stop before i got to the picket fence or not so but,explain,8,q1nc1
g,well,ready,8,q1nc1
g,do you not have to go round it,check,8,q1nc1
f,why it's just a fence,reply_w,8,q1nc1
g,it's it's not a picket fence here so the route must go round the picket fence surely,check,8,q1nc1
f,you think so,check,8,q1nc1
f,maybe it's the the route's to stay inside the picket fence,explain,8,q1nc1
g,well,ready,8,q1nc1
g,maybe it is okay as long as you're on the picket fence then i don't know,explain,8,q1nc1
f,i've got one d-- i've got one i don't know realise why it's there,explain,8,q1nc1
g,right right you went by the abandoned cottage right,align,8,q1nc1
